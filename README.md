# Boston_LR
Building a model that can provide a price estimate based on a home's characteristics like:
* The number of rooms
* The distance to employment centres
* How rich or poor the area is
* How many students there are per teacher in local schools etc

To accomplish the task I will:

1. Analyse and explore the Boston house price data
2. Split your data for training and testing
3. Run a Multivariable Regression
4. Evaluate how your model's coefficients and residuals
5. Use data transformation to improve your model performance
6. Use your model to estimate a property price
7. Dockerize the model
8. Deploy the model in an app
